# API Management Platform - Comprehensive Feature Documentation

## Authentication & Authorization Framework

The platform implements a robust authentication system powered by PocketBase, providing secure authentication for all API requests. Upon registration, users are automatically assigned the FREE role, granting them basic access to the platform's features.

### Role-Based Access Control

Our platform utilizes a sophisticated role-based access control system with three distinct user levels:

#### Administrator Access
Administrators represent the highest privilege level within the system. These accounts can only be created through direct database intervention, ensuring maximum security for administrative access. This design decision prevents potential security vulnerabilities that could arise from in-application admin creation.

Administrators possess unrestricted access to:
- API creation and modification capabilities
- User management functions
- System-wide analytics
- Configuration settings
- Unlimited API calls without rate limiting

#### Free User Access
Free users represent our base tier, offering limited but valuable access to the platform:
- Access to all FREE-tier APIs
- Basic usage analytics
- Rate limited to 30 requests per day
- API key management for authorized services
- Ability to request trial period activation

#### Trial Period System
Our platform features a unique 15-day trial system that allows free users to experience premium features without requiring payment integration:

**Trial Activation Process:**
1. Free users can request trial activation through their dashboard
2. System automatically upgrades their access level
3. 15-day countdown begins immediately
4. Users receive full access to both FREE and PAID APIs
5. Higher rate limits (1000 requests per day) are applied
6. System tracks usage throughout the trial period

**Trial Management:**
- Automated role reversion after 15 days
- One-time trial period per user account
- Clear notification system for trial status
- Usage statistics preservation after trial expiry

## API Management System

### API Creation and Configuration

The platform provides a sophisticated API creation interface that supports complex configurations:

**Base Configuration:**
```json
{
    "name": "Example API",
    "endpoint": "https://api.example.com",
    "type": "FREE|PAID",
    "rate_limit": 1000,
    "description": "Detailed API description",
    "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

**Endpoint Configuration:**
Each API can contain multiple endpoints, each supporting:
- Multiple HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Complex parameter configurations
- Custom headers
- Authorization requirements
- Rate limit overrides

### Parameter Management

The platform supports sophisticated parameter configuration:

```json
{
    "parameters": {
        "query": [
            {
                "name": "search",
                "type": "string",
                "required": false,
                "description": "Search query parameter",
                "validation": "min:3|max:50"
            }
        ],
        "path": [
            {
                "name": "id",
                "type": "integer",
                "required": true,
                "description": "Resource identifier"
            }
        ],
        "body": {
            "type": "json",
            "schema": {
                "properties": {
                    "title": {"type": "string"},
                    "content": {"type": "string"}
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### API Lifecycle Management

The platform implements a comprehensive API lifecycle management system:

**1. Creation Phase**
- Detailed validation of API configuration
- Endpoint testing capabilities
- Documentation generation
- Access control setup

**2. Active Phase**
- Real-time monitoring
- Usage analytics
- Rate limit enforcement
- Error tracking

**3. Maintenance Phase**
- Version management
- Configuration updates
- Parameter modifications
- Documentation updates

**4. Archival System**
The platform implements a soft-delete mechanism for APIs:
- APIs can be archived instead of permanently deleted
- Archived APIs maintain their configuration and usage history
- Restoration process preserves all original settings
- Historical data remains accessible for reporting

## Rate Limiting System

The platform implements a basic rate limiting mechanism to control API access based on user roles and API types.

### Current Rate Limit Implementation

The system utilizes custom middleware with the following configuration:

```json
{
    "rate_limits": {
        "FREE_USER": {
            "FREE_API": "30 requests per hour",
            "PAID_API": "no access"
        },
        "TRIAL_USER": {
            "FREE_API": "1000 requests per hour",
            "PAID_API": "1000 requests per hour"
        },
        "ADMIN": {
            "FREE_API": "unlimited",
            "PAID_API": "unlimited"
        }
    }
}
```

### Rate Limit Enforcement

The system implements rate limiting through middleware:

1. **Access Control**
   - FREE users can only access FREE APIs
   - TRIAL and ADMIN users can access both FREE and PAID APIs
   - All requests from FREE users to PAID APIs are blocked

2. **Request Limits**
   - FREE users: 30 requests per hour for FREE APIs
   - TRIAL users: 1000 requests per hour for all APIs
   - ADMIN users: Unlimited access to all APIs

3. **Usage Tracking**
   - Hourly request counting
   - Reset every hour
   - Simple violation logging

### Future Enhancements (Planned)
- Per-API rate limit configuration
- Concurrent request limiting
- Advanced usage analytics
- Custom rate limit policies
- Granular access control

### Rate Limit Implementation

The system utilizes custom middleware for granular control. Rate limiting occurs at multiple checkpoints:

1. **Request Validation Phase**
   - Validates user authentication
   - Checks user role permissions
   - Verifies API access rights
   - Evaluates current usage against limits

2. **Usage Tracking**
   - Real-time request counting
   - Daily usage reset at midnight UTC
   - Concurrent request monitoring
   - Rate limit violation logging

## Monitoring & Analytics System

### Real-Time Monitoring

The platform provides comprehensive real-time monitoring capabilities through an advanced analytics dashboard.

#### Usage Statistics
```json
{
    "api_metrics": {
        "total_requests": "integer",
        "successful_requests": "integer",
        "failed_requests": "integer",
        "average_response_time": "float",
        "error_rate": "float"
    },
    "user_metrics": {
        "daily_usage": "integer",
        "remaining_quota": "integer",
        "peak_usage_time": "timestamp",
        "frequent_endpoints": "array"
    }
}
```

#### Performance Monitoring

The system continuously tracks and analyzes:

1. **Response Time Metrics**
   - Average response time per endpoint
   - 95th percentile latency
   - Time-based performance degradation
   - Geographic response variations

2. **Error Rate Analysis**
   - Error frequency by endpoint
   - Error type distribution
   - Rate limit violations
   - Authentication failures

3. **System Health Indicators**
   - Server resource utilization
   - Database performance metrics
   - Cache hit/miss ratios
   - Queue processing statistics

## Security Framework

### Authentication Layer

The platform implements a multi-layered authentication system:

1. **Token-Based Authentication**
   ```json
   {
       "token_structure": {
           "header": {
               "alg": "HS256",
               "typ": "JWT"
           },
           "payload": {
               "user_id": "string",
               "role": "string",
               "permissions": "array",
               "exp": "timestamp"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **API Key Management**
   - Secure key generation using cryptographic methods
   - Automatic key rotation policies
   - Key usage tracking and analytics
   - Immediate key revocation capabilities

### Request Validation

Every API request undergoes comprehensive validation:

1. **Header Validation**
   ```json
   {
       "Authorization": "required|string|starts_with:Bearer",
       "X-API-Key": "required|string|exists:api_keys,key",
       "Content-Type": "required|in:application/json",
       "Accept": "required|in:application/json"
   }
   ```

2. **Payload Validation**
   - Input sanitization
   - Type checking
   - Size limitations
   - Format validation
   - SQL injection prevention

### Security Monitoring

The platform maintains comprehensive security logs:

```json
{
    "security_events": {
        "timestamp": "datetime",
        "event_type": "string",
        "user_id": "string",
        "ip_address": "string",
        "request_details": {

            "endpoint": "string",
            "headers": "array",
            "payload": "object"
        },
        "security_flags": "array"
    }
}
```
